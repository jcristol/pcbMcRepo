### Design Comments feel free to edit


- aparently the battery labels are screw up fix that(cody)

### TODO Cody

- Correct label for Battery screw terminal (the positive is currently labeled as negative which is incorrect)
- Turn around the NAP/Motor control double stack to face the same way as the other double stacks (canâ€™t currently plug in DB9 because it hits the edge of box) Ignore the fact that this will lengthen the board
- Move the myrio connectors to the middle bottom AND other side of the board. This will help with mounting Move the connections as close to the Zener diode as possible if we can move the Zener as well further down so we can keep moving the connector that would be even better
