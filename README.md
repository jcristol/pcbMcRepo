__Josh__

__Master merge on agreement__


### Design Comments feel free to edit

## BLOCKERS
1. Screw Terminals footprints need to be exact so the labels will fit
2. Ethernet Pin outs
3. Do we need pull up resistors on the bus?
4. The i2c stress test. Are the buses too full?
5. Specs on the housing for the myrio pinout on the PCB
6. Measure the diameter of the vin+ and vin- pins
7. Pin out on the power converters?


## EXTRA Features
1. Cody had special connectors for the robot car that we can use for the power and end connection
2. The screw terminals for extra shit

## Ben Questions
__Ethernet Pin Outs__

__i2c stress test how did that good?__ 

__Are the buses full and will this change the PCB design?__

__Do we need Pull up resistors on the bus?__

__Measure the diameter of the vin+ and vin- pins?__

__Pin out on the par converters i.e. vin, gnd, vout+, vout-?__

__Details on what extra screw terminals we need and how you want them arranged?__
